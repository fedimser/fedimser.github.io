		<h3><b>CayleyPy Growth: Efficient growth computations and hundreds of new conjectures on Cayley graphs</b> (2025)</b> </h3>
		<p>
			<b>Abstract (abbreviated). </b>
			This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory. 
			We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley
			and Schreier graphs.
			[...] 
			Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and
			growth.
			[...]
			To benchmark various methods of path-finding on Cayley graphs we
			create more than 10 benchmark datasets in the form of Kaggle challenges.
			[...]
			CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups, and supports a pre-defined collection of more
			than a hundred generators including puzzle groups. Our code for direct growth computation outperforms similar functions
			on the standard computer algebra system GAP/SAGE up to 1000 times both in speed and in maximum sizes of the graphs
			that it can handle.

		<h3><b>Quantum Arithmetic Algorithms: Implementation, Resource Estimation, and Comparison</b> (2025)</b> </h3>

		<p>
			<b>Abstract. </b>
			As quantum computing technology advances, the need for optimized arithmetic circuits continues to grow. This
			paper presents the implementation and resource estimation of a library of quantum arithmetic algorithms,
			including addition, multiplication, division, and modular exponentiation. Using the Azure Quantum Resource
			Estimator, we evaluate runtime, qubit usage, and space-time trade-offs and identify the best-performing
			algorithm for each arithmetic operation. We explore the design space for division, optimize windowed modular
			exponentiation, and identify the tipping point between multipliers, demonstrating effective applications of
			resource estimation in quantum research. Additionally, we highlight the impact of parallelization, reset
			operations, and uncomputation techniques on implementation and resource estimation. Our findings provide
			both a practical library and a valuable knowledge base for selecting and optimizing quantum arithmetic
			algorithms in real-world applications.

		<h3><b>New Circuit for Quantum Adder by Constant</b> (2025)</b> </h3>
		<p>
			<b>Abstract. </b>
			We propose a new circuit for in-place addition of a classical n-bit constant to a quantum n-qubit integer
			modulo 2n. Our circuit uses n-3 ancilla qubits and has a T-count of 4n-5.
			We also propose controlled version of this circuit that uses n-2 ancillas and has a T-count of 11n-15.
			We implement these circuits in Q#.

		<h3><b>Binary Tree Elimination algorithm for computing marginal probabilities in graphical models</b> (2022)</b>
		</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Abstract. </b>
			We propose a method to efficiently compute marginal probabilities for a probabilistic graphical model. This
			method can be built on top of any elimination algorithm for computing partition function and is
			significantly more efficient and accurate then the trivial reduction. We show how to apply this technique to
			three elimination algorithms: Bucket Elimination, Mini-Bucket Elimination and Mini-Bucket Renormalization.

		<p>
			<b>Abstract. </b>
			In this work we study methods of
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic models</a> visualization.
			We consider several ways of visualizing topic models (including temporal and hierarchical).
			We set a problem of building topic model spectrum - a permutation of its topics, in which
			semantically close topics are located nearby.
			We suggest several algorithms to solve this problem and design a method to assess their quality.
			The task is generalized for the case of hierarchical topic models.
			Also we describe informational system <a href="https://github.com/bigartm/visartm">VisARTM</a>,
			which is designed for automated creation and visualization of topic models.

		<h3><b>Mixtures of models of vector autoregression in the problem of time series forecasting</b> (2016)</h3>
		
		<p>
			<b>Abstract.</b> In this paper we investigate the problem of short-term time series forecasting. We consider
			the time series of different scales, which are interconnected and have the property of periodicity.
			Forecasting problem is reduced to the problem of regression, which is solved by using a linear model. To
			improve its accuracy we propose to use composition of models. The compositions are built using bagging,
			random subspace method and boosting algorithm AdaBoost. We also propose heuristic iterative algorithm of
			model composition based on the idea of ​​clustering algorithm K-means. Using the proposed methods, we
			forecast energy consumption in Turkey and Poland and spot prices on electricty in Germany.

		<h3><b>Percolation phenomenon in cellular automata</b> (2012)</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Abstract</b>. In this paper, we investigate synchronous cellular automata, similar to the 'Game of Life'.
			We study the phenomenon of percolation &mdash; abrupt filling of all cells during evolution from random
			initial state when critical concentration is reached. We give theoretical explanation to this phenomena.
			Also we study the dependency of borders and critical index of percolation from form of the grid and
			parameters of the automata.
